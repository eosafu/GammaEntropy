# Objective Bayesian analysis for the differential entropy of the Gamma distribution
We considered the gamma distribution, which describes many natural phenomena in physics, engineering, and biology. We reparametrize the model in terms of entropy, and different objective priors are derived, such as Jeffreys prior, reference prior, and matching priors. Since the obtained priors are improper, we prove that the obtained posterior distributions are proper and their respective posterior means are finite. An intensive simulation study is conducted to select the prior that returns better results in terms of bias, mean square error, and coverage probabilities. The proposed approach is illustrated in two datasets: the first one is related to the Achaemenid dynasty reign period, and the second data describes the time to failure of an electronic component in a sugarcane harvest machine.

The codes used in the simulation study are available in this repository.
